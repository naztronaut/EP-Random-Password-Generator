# EP-Random-Password-Generator
Quick PHP Script to generate random password between 6 and 100 characters - Boostrap, jQuery, HTML included

Script created for the Easy Programming Playground - being released soon at www.EasyProgramming.net

To Install: 

Upload password_generator.php and includes/pwslider.php

This script is bootstrapped and uses the jQuery UI slider to select number of characters in password. includes/pwslider.php contains the jQuery function which controls the slider. To remove slider, don't use the pwslider.php file and remove the following line from password_generator.php:
  <div id="slider"></div>
  
This script generates a random password using the chosen criteria and length. By default, it will use "Lower Case" if you don't check any of the criteria below.

Please note that in computers, there is NO such thing as true randomness. This is all pseudo random. This script should be used for learning purposes and for fun!

Demo location coming soon!
